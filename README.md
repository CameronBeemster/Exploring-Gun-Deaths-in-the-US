# Exploring-Gun-Deaths-in-the-US


Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This notebook is for a project I did while learning data science/analytics with <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/'>Dataquest</a>. 
The goal of this project was to practice using Python for data analysis. This project was one of my first Python projects.
The dataset was provided by <a href='https://github.com/fivethirtyeight'>FiveThirtyEight</a>.
