# Exploring-Gun-Deaths-in-the-US


Hello! Thank you for checking out my project.

This notebook is for a project I did while learning data science/analytics with Dataquest (https://www.dataquest.io). 
The goal of this project was to practice using Python for data analysis. This project was one of my first Python projects.
The dataset was provided by FiveThirtyEight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight).
